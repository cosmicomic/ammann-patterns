# ammann-patterns
Geometric visualizations of Ammann patterns, created using Turtle in Python.

Algorithm for generating the patterns was adapted from section 3.2, "Constructing irreducible Ammann patterns," from ["Coxeter Pairs, Ammann Patterns and Penrose-like Tilings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08215) by Boyle and Steinhardt.
